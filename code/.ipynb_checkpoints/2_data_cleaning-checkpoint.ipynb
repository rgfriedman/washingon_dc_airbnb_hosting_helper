This is defined as a listing having a review in the past 12 month or a listing having a host that started in the past 12 months but does not yet have a review. Although this cut the datset in half, this decision was made to gather the most accurate information on the DC Airbnb market right now. As I am looking to predict the most popular listings on the current market, listings on the site that are not acctive could confuse the predictions and make it less accurate. This is also in line with the way Airbnb shows listings on their site, they prioritize listings with the current reviews from the past year."

    "Since the DC airbnbs are all pretty high quality, I will look into different percentiles to see which should be used as a threshhold to help indicate popularity. Aboce, we can see that the 50th percentile has a very high rating of 4.83 and there are 2,035 listings in this category. Also, the 70th percentile of ratings is 4.93 and 1,224 airbnbs are in this category. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's clear that to be considered the best in DC, the airbnb needs to meet high rating standards. When thinking of consumers, a 4.83 out of 5 overall rating would indicate high quality and attract guests to want to stay there. To be considered popular in DC, it seems an overall rating of 4.83 (the 50th percentile) is reasonable, whereas the 4.93 rating may be too high. I will be using 4.83 as part of the metric to calculate popularity."

The horizontal and vertical red lines show where the cut offs are for our 'popular' criteria.
