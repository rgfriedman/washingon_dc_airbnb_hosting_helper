    "In this notebook, I will clean and prepare the listing data for further modeling. I will merge the neighborhood venue data collected from the Foursquare API with the Airbnb listing data. Then, I will create the target variable, popularity, based on number of reviews and overall rating. Finally, I will clean the rest of the data for any outliers, convert any values or columns to the correct values, and drop unnecessary columns. This cleaning and preparation will be done for all numerical or categorical data. The text processing for a few fields will be done in the 3_text_processing notebook."

Aboce, we can see that the 50th percentile has a very high rating of 4.85 and there are 1,891 listings in this category. Also, the 70th percentile of ratings is 4.94 and 1,141 airbnbs are in this category. \n",

    "It's clear that to be considered the best in DC, the airbnb needs to meet high rating standards. When thinking of consumers, a 4.85 out of 5 overall rating would indicate high quality and attract guests to want to stay there. To be considered popular in DC, it seems an overall rating close to 4.85 (the 50th percentile) is reasonable, whereas the 4.9 rating may be too high. I will be using a rating hovering around 4.85 as part of the metric to calculate popularity."

    "The graph above helps visualize the relationship of number of reviews to the rating. We can see that the ratings congregate above 4, but there is a increasing relationship between number of reviews and highest ratings and shows popularity. The horizontal and vertical red lines show where the cut offs are for our 'popular' criteria. I am looking to predict whether or not the listing will show up in the top right quandrant of the graph and looking to understand what features make this possible."
